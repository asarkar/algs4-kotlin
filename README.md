# kalgs4
Kotlin adaptation of the Java source code for the algorithms and clients in the textbook Algorithms, 
4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The official repo is [algs4](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4).

## Goals

1. Break up the project into logical submodules following the chapters of the book.
2. Write idiomatic Kotlin code, but try not to diverge too much from the original API.
3. Keep an eye, or two, on performance.
4. Above all, learn and get better at Kotlin and algorithms.
